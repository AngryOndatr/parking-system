# parking-system
This is a comprehensive pet project implementing an automated parking lot management system. The system is designed to handle automatic and manual modes of operation, manage subscriptions, calculate payments, and track parking space occupancy. The architecture is based on microservices.

## Folder Structure

- `backend/`: Spring Boot microservice code.
- `frontend/`: React web interface code.
- `devops/`: Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml`.
- `database/`: Migration scripts (e.g., Flyway or Liquibase).
